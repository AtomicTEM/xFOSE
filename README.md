## Installation

1. Copy the .dll and .exe files to your Fallout 3 directory. For Steam this is usually in your Program Files folder under *Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Fallout 3\\*. If you see files named Fallout3.exe and FalloutLauncher.exe, this is the correct folder. **Do not copy these files to the Data folder or install it with MO2 as with a normal mod.**

2. Launch FO3 via running *fose_loader.exe* or, if you have patched the game using [Anniversary Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/24913), *Fallout3.exe*. Enabling the Steam Community option (enabled by default) will allow you to launch the game via Steam's standard UI.

xFOSE is compatible with the Steam and GOG versions of the game. German No Gore, Xbox Gamepass, and Bethesda.net versions are not supported. Epic Games Store users can use the [Anniversary Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/24913).

## Description

**Fallout Script Extender** (FOSE) is a modder's resource that expands the scripting capabilities of Fallout 3. It does so without modifying the executable files on disk, so there are no permanent side effects.


For documentation on how to write scripts utilizing FOSE, see [GECK Wiki](https://geckwiki.com/index.php?title=Main_Page).
